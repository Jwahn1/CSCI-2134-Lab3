*********** ADD AS MANY MORE AS NEEDED *******************
Error 2:
  Method: add()
  Test Method:void  add()
  Message:add() function does not return null value when given null matrices as input
  Suggestion: remove "return res" when an incorrect input is given with "return null"
  Comments:

Error 3:
 Method: MultiplyWithScalar()
 Test Method : void MultiplyWithScalar()
 message : Scalar multiplcation failed 
 Suggestion : the res matrix always has unequivalent values compared the the matrix used to produce it
 as there is an off by one bug in the code, all that is needed is to fix the off by one that is cause the code
 to ignore the first row and column of the matrix multiplcation.
